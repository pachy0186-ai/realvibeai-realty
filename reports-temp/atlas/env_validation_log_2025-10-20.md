# Environment Validation Log - 2025-10-20

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The initial error "expected string or bytes-like object, got 'type'" was not directly reproducible with the provided `git status` and `npm run build` commands. However, the `npm run build` command initially failed with `sh: 1: next: not found`, indicating missing dependencies. After running `npm install`, the `npm run build` command executed successfully. This suggests that the original error might be related to an incomplete or improperly configured environment, or it might be an intermittent issue that did not manifest during this specific diagnostic run.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Cloned the repository: `gh repo clone pachy0186-ai/realvibeai-realty`
2. Navigated into the directory: `cd realvibeai-realty`
3. Executed `git status`: Successful.
4. Executed `npm run build`: Failed with `sh: 1: next: not found`.
5. Executed `npm install`: Successful.
6. Executed `npm run build` again: Successful.

## Patch or Bypass Strategy

Since the specific "expected string or bytes-like object, got 'type'" error did not manifest, and the `npm run build` issue was resolved by `npm install`, the immediate strategy is to ensure all necessary dependencies are installed before attempting build or other commands. If the original error reappears, further investigation into shell environment variables or Python interpreter interactions would be required.
