Subject: Take ownership of pre-launch build + deployment (code-freeze)

Context

Canonical repo: https://github.com/pachy0186-ai/realvibeai-realty

Current branch with unmerged work: feature/realty-basepath

Manus will continue proposing intel-suggested copy/SEO/a11y PRs only. Replit owns build + deployment.

Goals (pre-launch)

Centralize all work in the GitHub repo (no side workspaces as source of truth).

Ship the feature/realty-basepath changes safely.

Wire CI + Vercel so PRs → Preview, main → Production.

Keep code-freeze rules: no risky feature work; only reviewed PRs merge.

Immediate Actions

Open a PR: feature/realty-basepath → main.

Title: Prelaunch: basePath, Tailwind, SEO, a11y updates

Paste this summary (edit as needed):

Next.js App Router; basePath /realty; root → /realty redirect

Pages & API stubs present; npx next build passes; routes verified

Tailwind v4/PostCSS OK; path aliases OK; .env.example & lib/siteConfig.ts added

Add labels: prelaunch, needs-review. Assign to me.

Repo Governance (set up now)

Protect main: require PRs, 1 review, passing checks, linear history.

Add .github/CODEOWNERS so my review is required:

/app/**           @pachy0186-ai
/components/**    @pachy0186-ai
/pages/**         @pachy0186-ai
**/*.md           @pachy0186-ai


Add minimal CI at .github/workflows/ci.yml:

name: CI
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '20' }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint --if-present
      - run: npm run build --if-present


Vercel

Ensure project is connected to this GitHub repo.

PRs must create Preview deployments; merges to main → Production.

Coordinate with me to add env vars in Vercel (no secrets in code):

NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_LINKEDIN_URL

Private stubs (HubSpot, providers, blob) will stay empty until post-launch.

Scope & Freeze Rules

Only low-risk content/UX/SEO/a11y and configuration fixes.

No direct pushes to main. Use branches → PRs.

Manus PRs are labeled intel-suggested + needs-review; you may refine but don’t merge without my approval.

Acceptance Criteria (for this handoff)

 PR open for feature/realty-basepath with my summary in the description

 Branch protection enabled on main

 CI workflow present and passing on the PR

 Vercel linked to repo; Preview URL visible on the PR

 README update: “How to run, build, deploy”, env var list, and code-freeze note

 Post-launch issues created (labels: post-launch, content/feature/seo) for:

Contact form + validation + provider wiring

Pricing page content + comparison table

FAQ entries + collapsible UI

Schema.org (Org, Product/Service, FAQ)

Performance pass (fonts, images, CWV)

Privacy policy/legal

Communication

Reply in this thread confirming: remotes, CI status, Vercel connection, and links to the PR + Preview.

If blocked (permissions, env, deployment), list the exact blocker and the command/log line.

Definition of Done

I can review a green PR with a working Vercel Preview and merge it to deploy Production from main.

All non-critical work is tracked as post-launch issues.
