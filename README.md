## Social Profiles

This project includes a `SocialLinks` component that displays icons for LinkedIn and Facebook, driven by environment variables. This allows for easy management of social media links without hardcoding them in the codebase.

### Configuration

To display the social media icons, you need to set the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file or in your hosting provider's environment variable settings (e.g., Vercel):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_LINKEDIN_URL=https://www.linkedin.com/company/realvibe-ai-realty/
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_URL=https://www.facebook.com/share/1G11RPicxJ/?mibextid=wwXIfr
```

If a variable is not set, the corresponding icon will not be rendered.

### Component Usage

The `SocialLinks` component is used in the main layout (`app/layout.tsx`) to display the social media icons in the header and footer of the website.

### Implementation Notes

- The component uses inline SVG icons for both LinkedIn and Facebook to avoid external dependencies.
- Links open in a new tab using `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security.
- Accessibility is handled with `aria-label` attributes on each link.
- No tracking scripts are used, ensuring user privacy.
