# Initial Responsive Analysis Findings

## Home Page (/) - Desktop View Analysis

### Current Viewport: ~1024px width (desktop)

### Key Observations:

1. **Header Navigation**
   - Navigation appears to be using horizontal layout
   - Multiple navigation items: Home, Solutions, Virtual Staging, Pricing, Contact
   - Logo "RealVibeAI Realty" on the left
   - Appears to be responsive but needs mobile testing

2. **Hero Section**
   - Large heading "AI-Powered Lead Generation That Actually Works"
   - Two CTA buttons visible: "Get Hot Leads Now" and "Get AI previews in minutes & final renders in 24-48 h"
   - Purple gradient background
   - Stats section with "2 min Setup Time", "24/7 AI Working", "Significantly More Closings"

3. **Content Sections**
   - "The Complete Lead Generation System" with 3 feature cards
   - "How It Works" with numbered steps (1, 2, 3)
   - "Transparent Pricing" section with $49/month pricing
   - "What Agents Are Saying" testimonials section

4. **Potential Issues to Test on Mobile:**
   - Header navigation may need hamburger menu
   - Hero text sizing may be too large for small screens
   - CTA buttons may need stacking
   - Feature cards may need vertical stacking
   - Pricing section layout
   - Text readability on small screens

### Next Steps:
1. Test each target page on modern device viewports
2. Check for horizontal scroll issues
3. Verify CTA button accessibility (44px minimum)
4. Test image responsiveness
5. Check text sizing and readability
